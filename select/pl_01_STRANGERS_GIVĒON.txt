Look like you don't miss me at all
At least that's what I see
on the surface
Memories got lost in the fog
But is it even worth it?
You look like you're moving on
Heard you're seeing someone else,
this time you're really gone
Trading pictures on a shelf
'cause you can't be alone
It's only been a couple weeks,
so I'm coming off strong, my baby
How we go from "I love you"
to "How've you been?"?
All those nights in my arms.
How could you forget?
Guess I'm taking this hard
You told me I'm the one
Now I'm a stranger once again
Strangers again (Again)
We become strangers again (Again)
All because you can't love me yet
We become strangers again
Strangers
What did we become?
I know your fam still asks about me.
Why you playing dumb?
I know deep down
you'd snatch me back
if we get time alone
I know your group be chatting
'bout me when it's said and done
They listen to you fantasize
about what we can't become
I knew you were gone
for sure that time
When you barely even cried
My muse, showed your colors
Went blue to green,
now you're out of reach
How we go from "I love you"
to "How've you been?"?
All those nights in my arms.
How could you forget?
Guess I'm taking this hard
You told me I'm the one
Now I'm a stranger once again
Strangers again (Again)
We become strangers again (Again)
All because you can't love me yet
We become strangers again
Strangers again
Strangers
Strangers again
We become strangers
We become strangers
We become strangers
